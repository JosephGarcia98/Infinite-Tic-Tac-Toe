## Infinite Tic-Tac-Toe
A new way to play Tic-Tac-Toe. When a player places their fourth piece, their oldest move will disappear, allowing the game to not end in a draw and continuously go on.

## Current Features
Single or two-player mode  
An AI with minimax pruning  
Tracking players’ wins  
Infinity-play Tic-Tac-Toe  
Converted Javascript into modules  
The ability to turn off Infinite and play regular Tic-Tac-Toe   
Maybe add a menu rather than buttons
